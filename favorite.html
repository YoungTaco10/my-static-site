    <h1>FAVORITES</h1>
    <h2>Marvel</h2>
    <img src="https://www.komar.de/media/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/Category/Fototapeten/Marvel/komar-fototapeten-marvel.jpg" alt="Marvel Characters">
    <p>I AM A FAN OF MARVEL AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE MARVEL CLUB JOIN UP JOIN UP JOIN UP JOIN UP</p>
    <h2>Ice Cream</h2>
    <img src="icecream.jpg" alt="Ice Cream">
    <p>I LOVE ME SOME ICE CREAM. I have always loved ICE CREAM. My favorite location was Ample Hills, but then they closed. They reopened recently but it sadly is just not the same.</p>
    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>Some of my favorite teams:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chelsea FC</li>
        <li>FC Barcelona</li>
        <li>AS Roma</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Chelsea FC is my team, they just don't know how to play well right now. As a result of this being a fan of them is hard. Rival fans always bring up silly stats about how we haven't beaten a good team in 2 years,and while it is true it still hurts. </p>
    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>Here is a video of somebody benching</p>

    </video>
    <p>The word on the street is that back in my prime I could bench 225 for 2. These days I don't go to the gym enough because college stuff is always getting in the way.</p>
