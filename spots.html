          <td>Washington Square Park</td>
          <td>This is a pretty cool place to just chill and interact with some people who you will never see. In the heart of whatever campus NYU claims.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Hoyt-Schemerhorn Station</td>
          <td>Most popular G station, gets very very very very hot in the summers, where the Bad music video was filmed(Bad by Michael Jackson).</td>

            <td>The Piers</td>
            <td>Some people have said that this is the best soccer field in all of NYC. It has a beatiful view, but does that make up for how often I have kicked my own soccer ball into the East River, I don't know.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Smiling Pizza</td>
            <td>It's location by the 7th Ave G stop allows for easy access and is in some peoples mind the heart of Park Slope. Used to go here a lot, but I think you can really age out of the whole area.</td>
